# Morris-Mill (Mühle)

The Morris-Mill board game (in Switzerland known as "Mühle") is a popular game among kids that most of the Swiss populations is familiar with. The game dates back to Roman times, so it is pretty old.

This version of the game lets you play with your friend. For the moment, I have not programmed an AI to play against a single player, so you will need to find a friend to play with you.
